Relevant Experience
----------

**Senior Data Scientiste**, [Octopus Energy](https://octopus.energy) [KrakenFlex](https://www.krakenflex.com)
{{< rawhtml >}}
<br />
{{< /rawhtml >}}
_(August 2023 - Present)_
Working on putting consumers at the heart of the future energy system, by automating and optimising domestic low carbon technologies globally (solar + home batteries, heat pumps, electric vehicles) to help balance the grid while maintaining household preferences.


**Head of Data and Chief of Staffe**, [Octopus Energy](https://octopus.energy) [Centre for Net Zero](https://centrefornetzero.org)
{{< rawhtml >}}
<br />
{{< /rawhtml >}}
_(June 2021 - August 2023)_

A founding early hire to a new mission-driven autonomous research unit of Octopus Energy, with roles and responsibilities growing as the startup evolved:

* Built a high-quality ELT modern data stack platform and automation workflows using `dbt`, GCP and infrastructure-as-code methodologies for a small data team, with 100GBs of data from a variety of public and private data sources.

* Led and delivered multiple research projects increasing our understanding of how consumers could adopt and use low carbon technologies at scale in the future, managing research data scientists and analysts. High impact projects include:
  * Pioneering analysis into unlocking domestic flexibility ([Big Dirty Turn Down](https://octopus.energy/blog/the-big-dirty-reveal/), [Crowdflex](https://www.nationalgrideso.com/future-energy/virtual-energy-system/crowdflex)) and led the research and experimentation into domestic intelligent demand (domestic demand side response) programme ([Octopus Energy Saving Sessions](https://octopus.energy/blog/octopus-energy-saving-sessions/))
  * Scalable generative ML model for domestic smart meter data ([Faraday](https://medium.com/the-centre-for-net-zero-tech-blog/introducing-faraday-our-smart-meter-load-profile-generating-tool-98bfbdce6a13))
  * [Report](https://www.centrefornetzero.org/res/hitting-the-target/) into heat pump adoption, with an [open-source](https://github.com/centrefornetzero/domestic-heating-abm) agent-based simulation

* Research featuring in high profile trades and newspapers (e.g Telegraph, Carbon Brief), as well as presentations to panels and conferences including COP26.

* Hiring in key strategic positions, and responsible for broader data strategy and technology decisions.

**Lead Data Scientist**, [Optimise Prime](https://www.optimise-prime.com), Hitachi Social Innovation
{{< rawhtml >}}
<br />
{{< /rawhtml >}}
_(March 2020 - June 2021)_

I led a team of 6 people (inc. contractors) on worlds largest commercial EV trial (Optimise Prime), a £35m. Ofgem energy Innvoation project with partners Centrica, Uber, Royal Mail, UKPN & SSEN.

* Led technical delivery of 3 workstreams, analysing billions of datapoints from over 6,000 vehicles to drive the transition from petrol/diesel to electric. Specifically:
  * Built a powerful ML prediction model to recommend optimal chargepoint location in London for EV drivers, with quarterly updates to Uber and a talk delivered at Big Data LDN 2020. Resulted in the strategic placement of highly utilised on-shift chargepoints, greater driver confidence in EVs and Uber Green.
  * Analysed behavioural patterns of different commercial fleets, recommending optimal practices and vehicles to deploy as they transition to electric.
  * Delivered over £2m/yr in operational savings for Royal Mail across 10 depots through provisioning of smart charging systems and forecasting models to respond to flexibility events, ensuring risk and cost minimsation.
* Deployed cloud based web app (Azure, Django) for UKPN using modern web frameworks, REST APIs & software principles to reduce time for depot managers to purchase electric vehicles and secure grid connections with their DNO. This reduced potential network reinforcement and grid connection costs to the tune of £millions/year.
* Mentored 2 Data Scientists. Interviewed candidates for Data Science positions.

**Various AI / ML Research and Consultancy Roles**
