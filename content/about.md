# work
I am currently doing data science and optimisation at [Octopus Energy](https://octopus.energy) 🐙, specifically [Krakenflex](https://www.krakenflex.com) which controls GW's of domestic and commercial grid-connected assets globally.

Previously, I was the Head of Data and Chief of Staff for [Octopus Energy's Centre for Net Zero](https://centrefornetzero.org) (an autonomous research unit looking at the future energy system) and the Lead Data Scientist on [Optimise Prime](https://www.optimise-prime.com), the worlds largest commercial electric vehicle trial with [Royal Mail](https://www.royalmail.com), [Uber](https://www.uber.com) and [Centrica](https://www.centrica.com).

You can find a summary of the tech I use [here]({{< ref "/content/tech.md" >}}).
